title=Potential Exposure of PII in Email Content
description=A Potential Exposure of PII in Email Content detector is a machine learning model designed to identify emails that may contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII), such as names, addresses, phone numbers, pan card numbers, adhar card numbers, or financial details. It analyzes various aspects of the email, including the body text, attachments, metadata, and patterns indicative of sensitive data leakage. By leveraging advanced algorithms trained on large datasets, this classifier helps prevent unintentional or unauthorized disclosure of PII, enhancing email security and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.
